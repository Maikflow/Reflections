When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with other developers mainly.
    To retrieve your files from the cloud when you dont have local access to your
    files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Better control, it helps when collaborating to make sure thing added
    or removed by others do not break our local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones from one github repository to another. 

    Clones is the act of reproducing in its entirety one git repo 
    into another directory, be it remote or local.

    Branch Is the deviation from the linear evolution of your code.
    Branching is the act of separating commits into a more logical structure
    so that it evolves organically.

    I would use forking when I want to experiment on another persons code 
    and I want to take a quick look via the github website.

    I would use Clones when I am ready to modify a repository from github locally
    on my computer

    I would Branch my code when I feel the need to experiment on my own code or on a 
    forked repo to see how things change without the risk of breaking my code from production    


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can keep track of changes made by other people to the remote repository.
    It lets you know visually what has changed since you last cloned it.

and what would be harder?
