What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds the .git file which is where all the magic happens.
Commits begin to get tracked and put inside the .git file.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It adds precision and a lot more control when doing commits. 
It acts as a failsafe when comitting to avoid exceptions.
